## **How to Use**  

1. Open a **Google Docs** document.  
2. Click on the heading that says "TypeLapse"
3. Follow the instructions by pasting in your text and selecting your desired delay time in milliseconds.

## **Taking a Break**

The script includes a "break" feature that allows the script to pause typing after a specified number of characters. This can be useful for simulating more natural typing patterns, where a person might take short breaks while typing.

### **How to Enable Breaks**

1. When you click on the "TypeLapse" button, an overlay will appear with various options.
2. Check the "Enable Breaks" checkbox to activate the break feature.
3. Set the "Break Frequency" to determine how many characters are typed before taking a break.
4. Set the "Break Duration" to specify how long the break should last in milliseconds.
